Impact Of Government-imposed Closure Measures On Number Of Cases
In this project, I will examine the effect of full, partial and special case closures applied in Turkey during the Covid-19 pandemic on the number of cases. 
I will convey the understanding of closure of Turkey and define these types of closure. I will also consider before and after these closure processes and 
explain to you the effect of closures on the number of cases, which is the main purpose of my article.
Later in my article, I will examine the course of the increase in cases during these complete, partial and exceptions closures.
